In general, we reevaluate plans day-by-day and thus the roadmap may change at any point.

As of Dec 2024, here's what we're working on:
- The CLI has been rebuilt with a modern TUI using OpenTUI and React 19
- Core functionality has been moved to the SDK for local execution, and our CLI now fully uses it!
- Building more powerful agents, especially "base2", which is the next-gen default levelcode agent

## Completed

### Agent Swarms
- Multi-agent orchestration with team lead and teammate roles
- Dynamic agent spawning and task delegation
- Inter-agent messaging and coordination
- Shared task system for tracking work across agents

## Future Plans

### Swarm Enhancements
- **Persistent Teams Across Sessions** - Save and restore team configurations so agents can resume collaborative work between sessions
- **Team Templates** - Pre-configured team setups for common workflows (e.g., code review team, full-stack dev team, research team)
- **Remote Agent Support** - Allow agents to run on remote machines and coordinate across distributed environments
- **Team Performance Metrics** - Track and report on team efficiency, task completion rates, and agent utilization
- **Swarm Marketplace** - Community-driven marketplace for sharing and discovering team templates, agent configurations, and workflow patterns
