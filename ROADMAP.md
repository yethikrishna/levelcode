In general, we reevaluate plans day-by-day and thus the roadmap may change at any point.

As of Dec 2024, here's what we're working on:
- The CLI has been rebuilt with a modern TUI using OpenTUI and React 19
- Core functionality has been moved to the SDK for local execution, and our CLI now fully uses it!
- Building more powerful agents, especially "base2", which is the next-gen default levelcode agent
