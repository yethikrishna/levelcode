## LevelCode for Windows dev setup

Welcome!

For development, we have a shared windows machine, via shadow.tech.

### Accessing the machine

You can access the machine either from the browser or with the desktop app:

1. Shadow.tech Web viewer:

- Go to https://pc.shadow.tech/home

2. Shadow.tech desktop app:

- They claim its better, idk.
- https://shadow.tech/download/

Supposedly you can also use Window's Remote Desktop to access the machine instead, but I've not tried it. Shadow.tech claims their protocol is better optimized for lower bandwidth use & hence smoother performance.

## Set-up guide:

You shouldn't need this - but just in case you stop using Shadow.tech, or make a new account, here's a guide on how to get from a blank Windows install to a LevelCode install.

Surprisingly: most guides in fact recommend running everything in an Admin PowerShell, contra to advice to not use sudo on eg: Linux/macOS.

- Install Choco: Open PowerShell as Admin, and run the command from https://chocolatey.org/install
- Install NVM: Restart PowerShell (still as Admin) and run `choco install nvm -y`
- Install Node: Restart PowerShell (still as Admin) and run `nvm install node`
- Install LevelCode: Run `npm i -g levelcode`

## Common Windows Issues & Troubleshooting

Running into problems? Here are solutions to the most common Windows-specific issues.

### Issue: "Failed to determine latest version" on First Run

**Symptom**:
```powershell
PS C:\> levelcode
❌ Failed to determine latest version
Please check your internet connection and try again
```

**Cause**:
LevelCode checks GitHub for the latest release on first run. This fails when:
- Corporate firewall blocks `github.com`
- Proxy settings not configured
- Network connectivity issues
- VPN required for external access

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify GitHub access**:
   ```powershell
   curl https://github.com/LevelCodeAI/levelcode/releases.atom
   ```
   If this fails, you have a network/firewall issue.

2. **Configure npm proxy** (if behind corporate proxy):
   ```powershell
   npm config set proxy http://your-proxy-server:port
   npm config set https-proxy http://your-proxy-server:port
   ```

3. **Disable VPN temporarily** or whitelist GitHub in your firewall

4. **Clear npm cache and reinstall**:
   ```powershell
   npm cache clean --force
   npm uninstall -g levelcode
   npm install -g levelcode
   ```

### Issue: "Bash is required but was not found" Error

**Symptom**:
```
Bash is required but was not found on this Windows system.
```

**Cause**:
LevelCode requires bash for command execution. This error appears when:
- Git for Windows is not installed
- You're not running inside WSL
- bash.exe is not in your PATH

**Solutions**:

1. **Install Git for Windows** (recommended):
   - Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - This installs `bash.exe` which LevelCode will automatically detect
   - Works in PowerShell, CMD, or Git Bash terminals

2. **Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**:
   - Provides full Linux environment with native bash
   - Install: `wsl --install` in PowerShell (Admin)
   - Run levelcode inside WSL for best compatibility

3. **Set custom bash path** (advanced):
   - If bash.exe is installed in a non-standard location:
   ```powershell
   set LEVELCODE_GIT_BASH_PATH=C:\path\to\bash.exe
   ```

### Issue: Git Commands Fail on Windows

**Symptom**:
Git operations (commit, rebase, complex commands) fail with syntax errors or unexpected behavior.

**Cause**:
Complex git commands may have issues with Windows path handling or shell escaping.

**Solutions**:

1. **Ensure Git for Windows is installed**:
   - Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - LevelCode uses bash.exe from Git for Windows for command execution

2. **Use WSL for complex operations**:
   - Provides full Linux environment with native bash
   - Install: `wsl --install` in PowerShell (Admin)
   - Run levelcode inside WSL for best compatibility

**Reference**: Issue [#274](https://github.com/LevelCodeAI/levelcode/issues/274)

### Issue: Login Browser Window Fails to Open

**Symptom**:
```
Press ENTER to open your browser and finish logging in...

Caught exception: Error: Executable not found in $PATH: "start"
Error: Executable not found in $PATH: "start"
TLCWeb > Unable to login. Please try again by typing "login" in the terminal.
```

**Cause**:
When running LevelCode in Git Bash (MINGW64), the `start` command is not available in PATH. The browser auto-open feature fails.

**Solutions**:

1. **Manually open the login URL** (easiest):
   - LevelCode displays the login URL after the error
   - Copy the full URL starting with `https://levelcode.vercel.app/login?auth_code=...`
   - Paste into your browser
   - Complete login in browser
   - Return to terminal - login will succeed

2. **Use native Windows terminals**:
   - PowerShell: `powershell`
   - Command Prompt: `cmd`
   - These have `start` command available

3. **Clear cache if login still fails** (per issue #299):
   ```powershell
   npm cache clean --force
   npm uninstall -g levelcode
   npm install -g levelcode
   ```

### Message: "Update available: error → [version]"

**What it means**:
This is **not an error** - it's an informational message indicating:
- Your local binary needs to be downloaded/updated
- "error" is a placeholder version (not a real error state)
- LevelCode will automatically download the correct version

**What to do**:
- Wait for the download to complete: "Download complete! Starting LevelCode..."
- If download fails, check your internet connection
- If it persists, try the solutions in "Failed to determine latest version" above

**Reference**: Issue [#299](https://github.com/LevelCodeAI/levelcode/issues/299)
