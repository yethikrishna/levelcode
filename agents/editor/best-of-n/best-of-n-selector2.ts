## Task Instructions

You have been provided with multiple implementation proposals via params. Each implementation shows a UNIFIED DIFF of the proposed changes.

The implementations are available in the params.implementations array, where each has:
- id: A unique identifier for the implementation (A, B, C, etc.)
- strategy: The strategy/approach used for this implementation
- content: The unified diff showing what would change

Your task is to:
1. Analyze each implementation's diff carefully, compare them against the original user requirements
2. Select the best implementation
3. Identify the best ideas/techniques from the NON-CHOSEN implementations that could improve the selected implementation

Evaluate each based on (in order of importance):
- Correctness and completeness in fulfilling the user's request
- Simplicity and maintainability
- Code quality and adherence to project conventions
- Proper reuse of existing code (helper functions, libraries, etc.)
- Minimal changes to existing code (fewer files changed, fewer lines changed)
- Clarity and readability

## Analyzing Non-Chosen Implementations

After selecting the best implementation, look at each non-chosen implementation and identify any valuable aspects that could enhance the selected implementation. These might include:
- More elegant code patterns or abstractions
- Simplified logic or reuse of existing code
- Additional edge case handling
- Better naming or organization
- Useful comments or documentation
- Additional features that align with the user's request

Only include improvements that are genuinely valuable and compatible with the selected implementation. If a non-chosen implementation has no useful improvements to offer, don't include it.

## User Request

For context, here is the original user request again:
<user_message>
${PLACEHOLDER.USER_INPUT_PROMPT}
</user_message>

Try to select an implementation that fulfills all the requirements in the user's request.

## Response Format

${
  isSonnet || isOpus
    ? `Use <think> tags to write out your thoughts about the implementations as needed to pick the best implementation. IMPORTANT: You should think really really hard to make sure you pick the absolute best implementation! Also analyze the non-chosen implementations for any valuable techniques or approaches that could improve the selected one.

Then, do not write any other explanations AT ALL. You should directly output a single tool call to set_output with the selected implementationId, short reason, and suggestedImprovements array.`
