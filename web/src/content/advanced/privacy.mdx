# Privacy

Codebuff is designed with your privacy in mind. Here's how we handle your data.

## No 3rd-Party Training on Your Data

We only use AI model providers that **do not train on your data**.

## Logging

We store logs of your chat sessions for debugging and improving the Codebuff service. These logs help us diagnose issues and ensure reliability. They are kept secure and are not shared with third parties.

## Advertising

For the ads we display, we only use information from your current session context and basic profile data.

## How Codebuff Works

Our backend acts as a thin router that forwards your requests to model providers (like Anthropic and OpenAI). We don't process or analyze your code beyond what's necessary to serve your requests.

## Future: Full Privacy Mode

We're working on a **Privacy Mode** that won't store any data at all. This will give users who need maximum privacy complete control over their data. Stay tuned for updates.

## Questions?
