# Working with Large Projects

Codebuff works on large repos (we test against VS Code). If it wanders or burns credits, try these.

## Directory-Based Approach

Start Codebuff in the part of the repo you care about:

```bash
    cd backend
    codebuff
```

Or set `--cwd`:

```bash
    codebuff --cwd backend
```

This keeps the context tight.

## Knowledge Organization

For big trees, keep knowledge close to the code:

- Add `knowledge.md` files in important subdirectories:

  ```
  services/
  auth-service/
      knowledge.md
      src/
  user-service/
      knowledge.md
      src/
  api-gateway/
      knowledge.md
      src/
  ```

- Keep each file focused on that area
- Link related files when the areas overlap
- Use the root `knowledge.md` for cross-cutting notes

## Effective Communication

When asking for work in a large repo:

- Point to exact paths
- Mention related files up front
- Break large changes into smaller requests
- Use `--max` when you need Codebuff to load more files

## Performance Tips

- Trim noise with `.codebuffignore` and `.gitignore`
- Start in the most relevant subdirectory
- Split broad refactors into stages
- Let Codebuff handle file discovery instead of pasting long file lists
