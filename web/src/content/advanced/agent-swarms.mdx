# Agent Swarms

Agent Swarms let you spin up a coordinated team of AI agents that work together on complex tasks. A team lead agent delegates work to specialized teammates, each with a defined role and their own working context.

## Quick Start

### 1. Enable Swarm Features

```bash
/team:enable
```

Or set `swarmEnabled: true` in your LevelCode settings.

### 2. Create a Team

```bash
/team:create
```

You will be prompted for a team name and description. LevelCode creates a shared workspace on disk where team state, tasks, and messages are stored.

### 3. Spawn Agents

Once a team exists, the lead agent can spawn teammates using the `spawn_agents` tool. Each agent gets a role, a model, and an isolated working directory. Agents communicate through a file-based message protocol and coordinate through shared tasks.

### 4. Assign Work

Create tasks with the `task_create` tool and assign them to team members. Agents pick up tasks, mark them in-progress, and report back when done.

### 5. Monitor Progress

```bash
/team:status
```

View the current phase, member list, and task summary at any time.

</MarkdownTable>

## Role Reference

Every agent on a team has a role that defines its responsibilities. Roles range from leadership positions that coordinate work to specialists that focus on a single concern.

### Leadership Roles

<MarkdownTable>
| Role | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `coordinator` | Top-level orchestrator. Manages the team, assigns tasks, and drives phases forward. |
| `cto` | Technical strategy and architecture decisions. |
| `vp-engineering` | Engineering process and cross-team coordination. |
| `director` | Oversees a group of managers and their teams. |
| `manager` | Manages a subset of engineers, handles task breakdown. |
| `sub-manager` | Assists a manager with a smaller scope. |
| `product-lead` | Owns product requirements and prioritization. |
</MarkdownTable>

### Engineering Roles

<MarkdownTable>
| Role | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `fellow` | Deep technical expertise. Advises on the hardest problems. |
| `distinguished-engineer` | Senior technical leadership across the codebase. |
| `principal-engineer` | Drives architecture and cross-cutting concerns. |
| `senior-staff-engineer` | Leads large features end-to-end. |
| `staff-engineer` | Owns significant subsystems. |
| `super-senior` | Highly experienced engineer handling complex tasks. |
| `senior-engineer` | Core implementation work with mentoring responsibilities. |
| `mid-level-engineer` | Solid implementation work on well-defined tasks. |
| `junior-engineer` | Handles smaller, scoped tasks with guidance. |
| `intern` | Learning-oriented tasks with close supervision. |
| `apprentice` | Introductory tasks under direct mentorship. |
</MarkdownTable>

### Specialist Roles

<MarkdownTable>
| Role | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `researcher` | Investigates solutions, reads docs, explores options. |
| `scientist` | Data analysis, experimentation, and technical research. |
| `designer` | UI/UX design, component architecture, and visual concerns. |
| `tester` | Writes and runs tests, validates correctness. |
| `reviewer` | Code review, quality gates, and standards enforcement. |
</MarkdownTable>

## Development Phases

Teams progress through a linear sequence of development phases. Each phase unlocks additional tools and signals the maturity of the project.

### Phase Lifecycle

<MarkdownTable>
| Phase | Description | Available Team Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `planning` | Define goals, architecture, and task breakdown. No implementation yet. | `task_create`, `task_update`, `task_get`, `task_list` |
| `pre-alpha` | Core scaffolding begins. Team communication enabled. | Above + `send_message`, `team_create` |
| `alpha` | Active feature development and integration. | All tools including `team_delete`, `spawn_agents`, `spawn_agent_inline` |
| `beta` | Stabilization, testing, and bug fixes. | All tools |
| `production` | Code is production-ready and deployed. | All tools |
| `mature` | Ongoing maintenance and incremental improvements. | All tools |
</MarkdownTable>

Phases advance forward one step at a time. Use `/team:phase` to move to the next phase.

**Important:** Non-team tools (file reads, edits, shell commands) are always available regardless of phase. Only the team-specific collaboration tools listed above are gated.

## Team Tools

These tools are available to agents within a team context:

<MarkdownTable>
| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `team_create` | Create a new team with configuration |
| `team_delete` | Disband the current team |
| `spawn_agents` | Launch new agent teammates with specified roles |
| `spawn_agent_inline` | Spawn a single agent with inline configuration |
| `send_message` | Send a direct message or broadcast to teammates |
| `task_create` | Create a new task with subject, description, and metadata |
| `task_get` | Retrieve full details of a task by ID |
| `task_update` | Update task status, owner, dependencies, or description |
| `task_list` | List all tasks with filtering by status |
</MarkdownTable>

## Message Protocol

Agents communicate through a file-based message protocol. Message types include:

- **Direct messages** -- One agent sends a message to a specific teammate.
- **Broadcasts** -- A message sent to every member of the team.
- **Shutdown requests** -- A lead asks an agent to gracefully stop.
- **Plan approvals** -- Agents with `plan_mode_required` submit plans for review before proceeding.
- **Task completed** -- Automatic notification when an agent finishes a task.
- **Idle notifications** -- Agents signal they are ready for more work.

Messages are delivered asynchronously through each agent's inbox and polled during the agent's runtime loop.

## Configuration

### Team Settings

When creating a team, you can configure:

- **`maxMembers`** -- Maximum number of agents allowed on the team (default varies by plan).
- **`autoAssign`** -- When `true`, idle agents automatically pick up pending tasks.

### Agent Settings

Each spawned agent has:

- **`role`** -- One of the roles listed above.
- **`model`** -- The AI model to use for that agent.
- **`cwd`** -- The working directory for the agent's file operations.

### Enabling/Disabling

Swarm features are controlled by the `swarmEnabled` setting. Toggle it with:

```bash
/team:enable    # Turn on
/team:disable   # Turn off
```

When disabled, all team slash commands and tools are hidden from the interface.

## Example Workflow

Here is a typical workflow for a feature build:

1. **Planning phase** -- The lead creates tasks describing the work to be done.
2. **Advance to pre-alpha** -- `/team:phase` moves to `pre-alpha`, enabling messaging.
3. **Advance to alpha** -- `/team:phase` moves to `alpha`, unlocking agent spawning.
4. **Spawn the team** -- The lead spawns agents: a senior engineer for implementation, a tester for validation, and a researcher for dependency investigation.
5. **Work in parallel** -- Each agent picks up tasks, works independently, and sends messages when blocked or finished.
6. **Advance through beta and production** -- As work stabilizes, the lead advances phases, signaling the shift from feature work to hardening and release.
7. **Teardown** -- `/team:delete` cleans up the team when the project is complete.

## Tips

- Start small. A team of 2-3 agents is easier to coordinate than a large swarm.
- Use the `planning` phase to think through task breakdown before spawning agents.
- Assign clear, well-scoped tasks. Agents work best when they know exactly what to do.
- Use `send_message` for targeted communication rather than `broadcast` to reduce noise.
- Monitor progress with `/team:status` and `/team:members` regularly.
