# Codebuff vs Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's first-party coding assistant. Codebuff covers the same basics and adds its own workflow tools.

Both tools:

- Run in your terminal
- Understand your entire codebase context
- Can edit files and execute terminal commands
- Use Claude models (Codebuff uses Claude Opus 4.5 as its orchestrator)

## When to Choose Codebuff

Pick Codebuff if you want:

- Faster edits and responses ([benchmark](https://x.com/jahooma/status/1894224663817195599))
- Lower credit burn for similar work
- Context pulled from a broad code scan instead of one file at a time
- Fewer confirmation prompts while editing or running commands
- Tight, targeted diffs rather than wide rewrites
- TypeScript SDK and custom agents for scripted workflows

## When to Choose Claude Code

Pick Claude Code if you need:

- Direct Anthropic access for procurement or data-handling rules
- Enterprise controls handled by Anthropic (SSO, RBAC, compliance programs, private networking)
- Early access to Anthropic features and their management UI
