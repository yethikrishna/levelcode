# LevelCode as an Engineer

[Oliver Lukesch](https://blog.luk.sh/) is building [StartMatch](https://startmatch.ai/), a platform that helps European companies with grant applications. He wanted to ship faster without sacrificing code quality.

## Initial Attempts

He tried other tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) and asked them to implement features end to end. The responses were often generic boilerplate or off-target, so refactors still took him a lot of time.

## The Right Solution

LevelCode understood his structure and stuck to his patterns and libraries. His `knowledge.md` file gives it project details, and most fixes now only need small tweaks like adding an import.

Oliver now spends less time on routine coding and more on planning. When another developer joined, he used LevelCode to keep standards consistent.
