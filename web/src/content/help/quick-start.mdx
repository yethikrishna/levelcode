# Get started with LevelCode

## 1. Install LevelCode

Enter the following in your terminal, which could be inside your favorite IDE (VSCode, Cursor, etc.).

```bash
npm install -g @levelcode/cli
```

## 2. Navigate to your project directory

```bash
cd /path/to/your-repo
```

## 3. Run LevelCode

```bash
levelcode
```

LevelCode has multiple [modes](/docs/tips/modes): `plan` for planning without file changes, `max` for better results at higher cost and time. You can invoke them in the slash menu with `/mode`.

## 4. Initialize Your Project (Optional)

Run the `/init` command inside LevelCode to set up project-specific files:

```
/init
```

### What `/init` Creates

- `knowledge.md` — A starter file for documenting your project's setup commands, architecture, and coding conventions. LevelCode reads this to understand your project better.
- `.agents/types/` — TypeScript type definitions for creating custom agents.

### When to Use `/init`

- **New projects** — if you don't already have an AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md (LevelCode will also read these files).
- **Building custom agents** — running /init is the first step to [creating your own agents](/docs/walkthroughs/creating-your-first-agent)!

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues during installation:

1. **Permission issues** — The best fix is to install Node.js using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), which avoids permission problems entirely. Then run `npm install -g @levelcode/cli` again.

2. **Still Having Problems?**
   - On Mac/Linux, you can fix permissions with: `sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(npm config get prefix)/{lib/node_modules,bin,share}`
   - On Windows, run your terminal as administrator
