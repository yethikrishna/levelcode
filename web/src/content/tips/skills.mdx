# Skills

Skills are reusable instruction sets that LevelCode can load on-demand. They let you define domain-specific knowledge, workflows, and behaviors that the agent can invoke when needed.

## Why Use Skills?

- **Reusability** — Define instructions once, use them across multiple conversations
- **On-demand loading** — Skills are only loaded when needed, keeping context clean
- **Shareable** — Store skills globally or per-project, share with your team
- **Slash commands** — Every skill becomes a `/skill:name` command you can trigger directly

## Creating a Skill

### 1. Create the skill directory

Skills live in a `skills` directory inside `.agents/` or `.claude/`:

```
.agents/skills/my-skill/
```

### 2. Create the SKILL.md file

Each skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: A short description of what this skill does and when to invoke it
license: MIT
metadata:
  category: development
---

# My Skill

Your skill instructions go here...

## Knowledge

Background information and helpful context goes here.

## Instructions

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three
```

### Frontmatter Fields

- **`name`** (required) — Skill name (1-64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens)
- **`description`** (required) — Short description (1-1024 chars) shown when browsing skills
- **`metadata`** (optional) — Key-value pairs for additional categorization

### Name Validation Rules

Skill names must:
- Be 1-64 characters long
- Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Not start or end with a hyphen
- Not contain consecutive hyphens
- Match the directory name exactly

**Valid:** `git-release`, `api-design`, `review2`, `deploy-prod`

**Invalid:** `Git-Release`, `my--skill`, `-skill`, `skill-`

## Discovery Locations

Skills are loaded from these locations, in order of priority (later overrides earlier):

1. `~/.claude/skills/` — Global (Claude Code compatible)
2. `~/.agents/skills/` — Global
3. `.claude/skills/` — Project (Claude Code compatible)
4. `.agents/skills/` — Project (highest priority)

Project skills override global skills with the same name. The `.claude/` paths provide compatibility with Claude Code.

## Using Skills

### Slash Commands

Every skill becomes a slash command. Type `/skill:` to see available skills:

```
/skill:git-release
```

This loads the skill's instructions into the conversation.

### Agent Tool Invocation

LevelCode can also load skills automatically via the `skill` tool when it determines a skill is relevant. The agent sees available skills listed in its tool description and can call:

```typescript
skill({ name: "my-skill" })
```

The full `SKILL.md` content is then loaded into the conversation context.

## Example: Git Release Skill

Here's a practical example of a skill for managing releases:

```markdown
---
name: git-release
description: Guidelines for creating Git releases with semantic versioning
metadata:
  category: git
  audience: developers
---

# Git Release Workflow

Use this skill when creating a new release.

## Versioning

Follow semantic versioning (semver):
- **MAJOR** (1.0.0) — Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (0.1.0) — New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (0.0.1) — Bug fixes, backward compatible

## Release Checklist

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
3. Bump version in package.json
4. Create a git tag: `git tag v1.2.3`
5. Push with tags: `git push --follow-tags`

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` — New feature
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `docs:` — Documentation
- `chore:` — Maintenance
```

## Example: Code Review Skill

```markdown
---
name: review
description: Code review checklist and guidelines
metadata:
  category: quality
---

# Code Review Guidelines

## What to Check

1. **Correctness** — Does the code do what it's supposed to?
2. **Tests** — Are there adequate tests?
3. **Security** — Any potential vulnerabilities?
4. **Performance** — Any obvious inefficiencies?
5. **Readability** — Is the code clear and well-documented?

## Feedback Style

- Be constructive and specific
- Suggest alternatives, don't just criticize
- Acknowledge good patterns
```

## Best Practices

### Keep Skills Focused

Each skill should have a single, clear purpose. Instead of one large "development" skill, create separate skills:

- `git-release` — Release workflow
- `api-design` — API design guidelines
- `testing` — Testing conventions

### Write Clear Descriptions

The description is what LevelCode sees when deciding whether to load a skill. Make it specific:

**Good:** `Guidelines for creating Git releases with semantic versioning and changelog updates`

**Bad:** `Git stuff`

### Use Metadata for Organization

Metadata helps categorize skills:

```yaml
metadata:
  category: deployment
  language: typescript
  framework: nextjs
```

## Global vs Project Skills

**Global skills** (`~/.agents/skills/`):
- Personal workflows
- Cross-project tools
- Your coding preferences

**Project skills** (`.agents/skills/`):
- Team conventions
- Project-specific processes
- Codebase-specific knowledge

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Appearing

1. Check the directory structure: `project-root/.agents/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`
2. Verify the name in frontmatter matches the directory name
3. Ensure the name follows validation rules (lowercase, hyphens only)
4. Restart LevelCode to reload skills

### Invalid Frontmatter

Ensure your YAML frontmatter:
- Starts and ends with `---`
- Has required `name` and `description` fields
- Uses valid YAML syntax

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: This is required
---
```
