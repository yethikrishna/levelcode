# Knowledge Files

`knowledge.md` files give Codebuff context about your project: conventions, architecture decisions, commands to run.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to create a knowledge file is to run the `/init` command inside Codebuff:

```bash
codebuff
```

Then inside the CLI:

```
/init
```

This analyzes your project and generates a `knowledge.md` file with relevant information about your codebase, including build commands, project structure, and conventions.

### Manual Creation

You can also create knowledge files manually:

```bash
touch knowledge.md
```

Or ask Codebuff to create one for you:

```bash
codebuff "Please create a knowledge.md file with initial project information"
```

For larger projects, you can optionally create additional knowledge files in subdirectories:

```bash
touch backend/knowledge.md frontend/knowledge.md
```

Keep each file next to the code it describes.

## What to Include

Capture facts that aren't obvious from the code:

- Project goals and mission
- Technical decisions and their rationale
- Coding standards and best practices
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Tips for working with project-specific tools
- Links to important documentation
- Build and deployment requirements
- Testing guidelines
- Verification commands to run after changes (e.g., `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, or `npm test`)

A few hundred lines is fine.

## Home Directory Knowledge Files

In addition to project-specific knowledge files, you can create a **global knowledge file** in your home directory. This is useful for preferences that apply across all your projects.

### Supported File Names

Codebuff looks for these files in your home directory (in priority order):

1. `~/.knowledge.md` (highest priority)
2. `~/.AGENTS.md`
3. `~/.CLAUDE.md`

Only the first file found is used. File name matching is **case-insensitive**, so `~/.KNOWLEDGE.md` or `~/.Knowledge.md` will also work.

### Creating a Home Directory Knowledge File

```bash
touch ~/.knowledge.md
```

Then add your global preferences:

```markdown
# User Preferences

## Coding Style
- Always use TypeScript over JavaScript
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add JSDoc comments to exported functions

## Communication
- Be concise in explanations
- Show examples when explaining concepts
- Ask for clarification on ambiguous requests

## Tools & Frameworks
- I prefer React over Vue
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Prefer pnpm over npm
```

### When to Use Home Directory vs Project Knowledge Files

| Home Directory (`~/.knowledge.md`) | Project (`knowledge.md`) |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Personal coding preferences | Project-specific conventions |
| Preferred frameworks/tools | Architecture decisions |
| Communication style | Build and deploy commands |
| Global defaults | Team coding standards |

Both files are loaded—project knowledge files add to (and can override) your home directory preferences.

## Post-Change Verification

Add commands for Codebuff to run after edits:

```markdown
## Verifying Changes

After any code changes, run these commands to verify correctness:

- Run `npm run typecheck` to check for type errors
- Run `npm test` to ensure tests pass
```

Codebuff runs these after making changes.
