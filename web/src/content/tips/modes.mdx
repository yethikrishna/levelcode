# Modes

Codebuff has four modes. Switch during a session with `Shift+Tab` or `/mode:` commands.

<MarkdownTable>
| Mode | Model | Editor Agent | Code Review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default | Claude Opus 4.5 | editor | Yes |
| Max | Claude Opus 4.5 | editor-multi-prompt | Yes |
| Plan | Claude Opus 4.5 | None | No |
| Free | Grok 4.1 Fast | editor-glm | No |
</MarkdownTable>

## Default

Standard mode with Claude Opus 4.5:

- Spawns [file pickers](/publishers/codebuff/agents/file-picker) and [code searchers](/publishers/codebuff/agents/code-searcher) to gather context
- Uses the [`editor`](/publishers/codebuff/agents/editor) agent for code changes
- Spawns [`thinker`](/publishers/codebuff/agents/thinker) for complex problems
- Runs code review after changes
- Validates with typechecks and tests

Switch to this mode with `/mode:default`.

## Max

Claude Opus 4.5 with best-of-N selection:

- Reads 12-20+ files per task
- Spawns multiple [editor](/publishers/codebuff/agents/editor) agents in parallel, each with a different strategy
- A selector compares outputs and picks the best one
- Spawns [`thinker-best-of-n-opus`](/publishers/codebuff/agents/thinker-best-of-n-opus) for hard problems
- Spawns multiple reviewers with different focus areas
- Runs typechecks and tests on both the changed files and the full project

Use for complex features and refactors.

Switch to this mode with `/mode:max`.

## Plan

Planning mode. No file writes.

- Gathers context about your codebase
- Asks clarifying questions using `ask_user`
- Outputs a spec/plan wrapped in `<PLAN>` tags
- Includes requirements, constraints, and relevant files

Use this to scope out work before implementing, or to discuss approaches without making changes.

Switch to this mode with `/mode:plan`.

## Free

Grok 4.1 Fast, cheaper and faster:

- Less file context gathering
- Uses GLM 4.7 for code changes ([`editor-glm`](/publishers/codebuff/agents/editor-glm) agent)
- Skips code review
- No todo tracking

Good for quick fixes and simple questions.

Switch to this mode with `/mode:free`.
