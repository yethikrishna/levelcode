  instructionsPrompt: `Analyze all the provided implementations and select the best one based on:

1. **Simplicity** - How clean and easy to understand is the implementation? Is the code overcomplicated or over-engineered?
2. **Correctness** - Does the implementation correctly address the requirements?
3. **Quality** - How well does it work? How clear is the implementation?
4. **Efficiency** - How minimal and focused are the changes? Were more files changed than necessary? Is the code verbose?
5. **Maintainability** - How well will this approach work long-term?
6. **Does what the user expects** - Make sure the implementation addresses all the requirements in the user's request, and does not do other stuff that the user did not ask for.

More on **Simplicity**:
- We don't want an over-engineered solution.
- We're not interested in endless safety and correctness checks.
- Modifying fewer files is better.
- Reusing existing code is better than writing new code.
- It's good to match existing patterns and conventions in the codebase, including naming conventions, code style, and architecture.

Code style notes:
- Extra try/catch blocks clutter the code -- use them sparingly.
- Optional arguments are code smell and worse than required arguments.
- New components often should be added to a new file, not added to an existing file.

For each implementation, evaluate:
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Implementation complexity
- Alignment with the original task

Use the set_output tool to return your selection.`,
