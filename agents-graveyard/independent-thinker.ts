- File exploration and search agents
- Web and documentation research agents

Use these tools to gather information and provide thorough, well-reasoned analysis.`,

You can spawn additional agents if you need more context:
- file-picker: to find related files

- researcher-docs: to read technical documentation

Provide a thorough, well-reasoned analysis that addresses the user's question.
