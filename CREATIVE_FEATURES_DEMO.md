I've just created a brand new agent specialized in adding delightful, creative features to codebases! Here's what's been added:

## 🎪 New Terminal Commands

# Typewriter effect for any message
type Hello, Creative World!
type Welcome to the future of coding!
```

## 🌟 Enhanced UI Components

### Neon Gradient Button
- Added hover glow effects
- Subtle pulsing animation
- Enhanced shadow transitions

### New GlitchText Component
- Subtle glitch effects on hover (15% chance)

```
